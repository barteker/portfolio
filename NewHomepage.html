            <section class="bio txt">
                <p>Born and raised in Menlo Park, CA, I have always been a creative and a problem solver. This led me to enroll at CU Boulder pursuing a dual degree in Piano Performance as well as one in Creative Technology and Design.</p>
                
                <p>I love making things that look, feel, and sound intentional; now I want to help others broadcast their passions in a clean cohesive and concise manner. If I can't make your vision come true, I know someone who can. Either way, I want to help you figure it out!</p>
